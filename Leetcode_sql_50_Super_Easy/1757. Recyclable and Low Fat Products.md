Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |

product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

Note:
In SQL, the TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to quickly delete all rows from a table. Unlike the DELETE statement, which removes rows one at a time and logs individual row deletions, TRUNCATE TABLE is a more efficient operation for removing all data from a table.
