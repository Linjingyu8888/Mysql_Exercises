| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).


## Note:
JOIN Weather ww ON w.recordDate = DATE_ADD(ww.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY): 
This is a self-join. It connects the Weather table (aliased as w) with itself (aliased as ww). 
The join condition is that the recordDate of the current day (w.recordDate) should be equal to the recordDate of the next day (DATE_ADD(ww.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)). 
This join pairs each day's data with the data of the following day.
