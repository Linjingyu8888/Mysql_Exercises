In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+

-- note:
--In this example, the query retrieves all rows where the value in your_column is not equal to 'some_value' or where the value is NULL. 
--The IS NULL condition is used to include rows where the column is NULL.
--Note that using the standard inequality operator (<> or !=) with NULL values might behave differently depending on the database system. 
--In SQL, NULL is considered unknown, so comparing anything (including NULL) with an unknown value using the standard inequality operator results in an unknown result. 
--Therefore, explicitly including the IS NULL condition is often necessary for the desired outcome.
